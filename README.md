## Overview :writing_hand:
The Product Manager is a web application developed with React and Sass that allows you to efficiently manage products. The application provides functionalities to add, edit, delete, and view products. It includes a form for adding and editing products, as well as a table that displays the registered products. The application connects to a backend API developed in Express to handle the data.
This repository contains the frontend structure, here is the link of the backend repository: [Backend-Repository](https://github.com/viamazoba/CrudProject-Express),and the link of the application deployed in vercel: [Deployed Project](https://crud-project-react-express.vercel.app/)

### Installation :gear:
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/erickfabiandev/CrudProject-React-Express
  ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```shell
cd CrudProject-React-Express
 ```
3. Install the dependencies:
```shell
 npm install
  ```
4. Start the application: 
```shell

  ```

### The Challenge :weight_lifting_man:
The main challenge of this project is to develop a web application that allows efficient management of products. The key functionalities include:

* Add products: Use the form to add new products to the database via the backend API.
* Edit products: Modify the information of existing products using the form and update the changes via the API.
* Delete products: Remove products from the database via the API with a single click.
* View products: The table displays the registered products obtained from the API in a clear and organized manner.

## My Process :mountain:
### Built With :hammer_and_wrench:
The project was built using the following technologies:

* React: JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
* Sass: CSS preprocessor for easy and organized styling.
* API: The application consumes a backend API developed in Express to manage product data.

### What I Learned :microscope:
During the development of this project, I gained experience in:

* Utilizing React to create reusable components and manage the application state.
* Applying custom styles using Sass to enhance the visual appearance.
* Consuming an Express backend API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products.

### Continued Development :briefcase:
In the future, there are plans to improve the Product Manager with the following features:

* Implement user authentication to secure product management actions.
* Add filtering and search functionalities based on the API to facilitate product exploration.
* Enhance the user interface and user experience to make it more intuitive and appealing.

### Useful Resources :sos:
During the development of this project, the following resources were helpful:

* Official React documentation: https://reactjs.org/docs
* Official Sass documentation: https://sass-lang.com/documentation
